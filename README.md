# About

This is a _development_ version of the [Lumpen Radio App](https://habd.as/work/) redone for Android support, which was not a thing in React Native when I originally created it. This app was previously featured on the [React Native Showcase](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase.html).

To access the source code from the original version of the app please head over to the [`master-backup`](https://github.com/jhabdas/lumpen-radio/tree/master-backup)  branch.
